Run/Debug in a Developer Environment 
====================================

Assuming you have setup a developer environment, you can run a development version of the bluesky worker.

.. seealso:: `./dev-install`


Start Bluesky Worker
--------------------

Ensure you are inside your virtual environment:

.. code:: shell

    source venv/bin/activate


You will need to follow the instructions for setting up ActiveMQ as in `../../user/how-to/run-cli`. 

The worker will be available from the command line (``blueapi serve``), but can be started from vscode with additional 
debugging capabilities.

1. Navigate to "Run and Debug" in the left hand menu.
2. Select "Worker Service" from the debug configuration.
3. Click the green "Run Button"
