2. API Model Case
=================

Date: 2023-05-23

Status
------

Accepted

Context
-------

Considering whether keys in JSON blobs from the API should be in snake_case or camelCase.
This includes plan parameters which may be user-defined.

Decision
--------

The priority is not to confuse users, so we will not alias any field names defined in Python.

Consequences
------------

Most code will be written with pep8 enforcers which means most field names will be snake_case.
Some user defined ones may differ.
