Configure the application
=========================

By default, configuration options are ingested from pydantic BaseModels,
however the option exists to override these by defining a yaml file which
can be passed to the ``blueapi`` command.

An example of this yaml file is found in ``config/defaults.yaml``, which follows
the schema defined in ``src/blueapi/config.py`` in the ``ApplicationConfig`` 
object.

To set your own application configuration, edit this file (or write your own)
and simply pass it to the CLI by typing::

    $ blueapi --config path/to/file.yaml

where ``path/to/file.yaml`` is the relative path to the configuration file you
wish to use. Then, any subsequent calls to child commands of blueapi will
use this file.
