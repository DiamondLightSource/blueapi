# Contributing to the project

Contributions and issues are most welcome! All issues and pull requests
are handled through
[GitHub](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/blueapi/issues). Also,
please check for any existing issues before filing a new one. If you
have a great idea but it involves big changes, please file a ticket
before making a pull request! We want to make sure you don't spend your
time coding something that might not fit the scope of the project.

## Issue or Discussion?

Github also offers
[discussions](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/blueapi/discussions)
as a place to ask questions and share ideas. If your issue is open ended
and it is not obvious when it can be "closed", please raise it as a
discussion instead.

## Code coverage

While 100% code coverage does not make a library bug-free, it
significantly reduces the number of easily caught bugs! Please make sure
coverage remains the same or is improved by a pull request!

## Developer guide

The [Developer
Guide](https://DiamondLightSource.github.io/blueapi/main/developer/how-to/contribute.html)
contains information on setting up a development environment, running
the tests and what standards the code and documentation should follow.
