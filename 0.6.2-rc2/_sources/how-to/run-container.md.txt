# Run in a Container

Pre-built containers with blueapi and its dependencies already
installed are available on `Github Container Registry
<https://ghcr.io/DiamondLightSource/blueapi>`_.

## Starting the container

To pull the container from github container registry and run::

```
docker run ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/blueapi:latest
```

with `podman`:

```
podman run ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/blueapi:latest
```

To get a released version, use a numbered release instead of `latest`.
