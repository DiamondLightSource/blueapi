# Configure the application

Blueapi's default configuration can be overridden 
by defining a yaml file which can be passed to the `blueapi` command.

:::{seealso}
[Configuration Reference](../reference/api.md) for the settable config values
:::

To set your own application configuration create a file and pass it to the CLI:

``` 
blueapi --config path/to/file.yaml <subcommand>
```
