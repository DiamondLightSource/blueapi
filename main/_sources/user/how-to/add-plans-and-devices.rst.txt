Add Plans and Devices to your Blueapi Environment
=================================================

Custom plans and devices, tailored to individual experimental environments, can be added via configuration. In both cases the relevant code must be in your Python path, for example, part of a library installed in your Python environment. For editing and tweaking you can use an editable install, see below.

Home of Code
------------

The code can be in any pip-installable package, such as:

* A package on pypi
* A Github repository
* A local directory with a ``pyproject.toml`` file or similar.

The easiest place to put the code is a repository created with the `python skeleton`_. Which can then become any of the above.

.. seealso:: Guide to setting up a new Python project with an environment and a standard set of tools: `New Skeleton Project Tutorial`_

For development purposes this code should be installed into your environment with 

.. code:: shell

  pip install -e path/to/package

Format
------

Plans in Python files look like this:

.. note:: The type annotations (e.g. ``: str``, ``: int``, ``-> MsgGenerator``) are required as blueapi uses them to generate an API!

You can define as many plans as you like in a single Python file or spread them over multiple files.

.. code:: python

    from bluesky.protocols import Readable, Movable
    from blueapi.core import MsgGenerator
    from typing import Mapping, Any

    def my_plan(
        detector: Readable, 
        motor: Movable, 
        steps: int, 
        sample_name: str, 
        extra_metadata: Mapping[str, Any]) -> MsgGenerator:
        
        # logic goes here
        ...


Devices are made using the dodal_ style available through factory functions like this:

.. note:: The return type annotation ``-> MyTypeOfDetector`` is required as blueapi uses it to determine that this function creates a device. Meaning you can have a Python file where only some functions create devices and they will be automatically picked up.

Similarly, these functions can be organized per-preference into files.

.. code:: python

    from my_facility_devices import MyTypeOfDetector

    def my_detector(name: str) -> MyTypeOfDetector:
        return MyTypeOfDetector(name, {"other_config": "foo"})


.. seealso:: dodal_ for many more examples

An extra function to create the device is used to preserve side-effect-free imports. Each device must have its own factory function.


Configuration
-------------

.. seealso:: `./configure-app`

First determine the import path of your code. If you were going to import it in a Python file, what would you put?
For example:

.. code:: python

    import my_plan_library.tomography.plans

You would add the following into your configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

    env:
      sources:
        - kind: dodal
          # note, this code does not have to be inside dodal just because it uses
          # the dodal kind. The module referenced contains a dodal-style function
          # for initializing a particular device e.g. MyTypeOfDetector in my_lab.
          module: dodal.my_beamline  
        - kind: planFunctions
          module: my_plan_library.tomography.plans


You can have as many sources for plans and devices as are needed.


Scratch Area on Kubernetes
--------------------------

Sometimes in-the-loop development of plans and devices may be required. If running blueapi out of a virtual environment local packages can be installed with ``pip install -e path/to/package``, but there is also a way to support editable packages on Kubernetes with a shared filesystem.

Blueapi can be configured to install editable Python packages from a chosen directory, the helm chart can mount this directory from the
host machine, include the following in your ``values.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

  scratch:
    hostPath: path/to/scratch/area  # e.g. /dls_sw/<my_beamline>/software/blueapi/scratch

You can then clone projects into the scratch directory and blueapi will automatically incorporate them on startup. You must still include configuration to load the plans and devices from specific modules within those packages, see above.
